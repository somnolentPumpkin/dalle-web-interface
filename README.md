# DALL-E API WEB INTERFACE
This is an HTML interface for interacting with OpenAI's DALL-E API.

You can use it from this link: https://somnolentpumpkin.github.io/dalle-web-interface/

You need to have your own OpenAI API token in order to use this.

The API token gets stored in your browser's localStorage so that you don't have to re-enter it every time you load the page.

It also remembers the last resolution you selected, as well as the last prompt you entered.

It includes a **Repeat last** button, which makes it easy to run the same prompt multiple times without having to type or copy/paste.

I made this entirely for myself, so it's meant to be functional, not beautiful. :)

Works on mobile.
