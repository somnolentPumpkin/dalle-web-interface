# DALL-E API WEB INTERFACE
This is an HTML interface for interacting with OpenAI's DALL-E API.

You can use it from this link: https://somnolentpumpkin.github.io/dalle-web-interface/

You need to have your own OpenAI API token in order to use this.

The API token gets stored in your browser's localStorage so that you don't have to re-enter it every time you load the page.

It also remembers the last resolution you selected, as well as the last prompt you entered.

It includes a **Repeat last** button, which makes it easy to run the same prompt multiple times without having to type or copy/paste.

I made this entirely for myself, so it's meant to be functional, not beautiful. :)

Works on mobile.

# How to use
1. Create an account at: [beta.openai.com/signup](https://beta.openai.com/signup)
2. Generate an [API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) and copy it to your clipboard.
3. Go to the [DALL-E page linked above](https://somnolentpumpkin.github.io/dalle-web-interface/) and paste your API key where it asks for an API token.
4. Type in your prompt, select the resolution you want the generated image to be, and drag the slider to the number of images you want it to generate for that prompt.
5. Click **Generate** and wait for the result!

**Note:** Your token is stored locally in your web browser. It is never transmitted to me in any capacity.
